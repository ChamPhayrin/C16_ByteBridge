<h2>Why is it important that we tackle the digital divide?</h2>
<p> We rely on digital access for virtually everything — from connecting with others to accessing information. Yet, not everyone has access to the digital realm. For some, accessing digital resources is difficult - sometimes impossible - due to a persistent digital divide. 
</p> 
<p> Available jobs require digital skills. It is estimated that over the next five years, the global workforce will have 149 million new technology-oriented jobs.

    <h2>Why is access to technology important?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All Americans, regardless of their region, should have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy. It's a matter of equity.</li>
        <li>63% of students in the US engage in online learning activities daily.</li>
        <li>We rely on the Internet for the majority of our day-to-day processes. Without access to the internet. How would you get online work done? Talk to friends or family? Schedule appointments? Learn? Pay bills? The answer’s pretty simple: You wouldn’t. Because we live in a technology-driven society, many aspects of our lives require digital interactions.</li>

        <h2>How does our organization close the digital divide and provide resources for minority youth interested in a technical career?
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                According to  The Forbes advisor webpage, A coding bootcamp can prepare you to succeed in tech by teaching you the skills required to be a web developer or computer programmer. Bootcamp students learn to code in a fast-paced, rigorous format—without having to earn a four-year degree. Our organization not only provides the technology necessary to complete these bootcamps, but we provide the bootcamp as well!
            </li>
            <li>We know the prices of some of these online materials can be quite steep, and because we are catered to underfunded school districts, we set out to provide free, in-depth material for students who are interested in coding, and information technology.</li>
            <li>College can be expensive, and gaining these technical skills, while developing a portfolio early on allows participants to break into tech spaces without breaking the bank. </li>
