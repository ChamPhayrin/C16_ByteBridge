            <h2>How will students communicate with instructors?</h2>
            <p>While the courses are taught in-person and online, we have contact information for organization leaders and instructors that will be made available to students. On the first day of the bootcamp, students will be added to slack channels, where they will be able to ask questions and collaborate with their instructors and peers for additional guidance.</p>
            <p>  Students will also have opportunities to ask instructors questions following the in-person sessions.</p>
